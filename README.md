Current issues:

- [ ] Optimize performance of the website

  - [x] Optimize Homepage
  - [ ] Optimize Course Pages
  - [ ] Optimize Components

- [ ] Refactor code

- [ ] Rework design of the website

Ideas:

- [ ] Add switch language feature (for example, switch between C and C++ in the code compiler)
- [ ] Add a file system for the code compiler (for example, app.py, app.c, etc.)
- [ ] Use xterm.js for the output/input of the code compiler
- [ ] Add live output/input of the code compiler

Legend:

- Completed: Feature is fully implemented and live
- In Progress: Feature is currently being developed
- Planned: Feature is in the roadmap but development hasn't started
- Future Update: Additional improvements planned for an already completed feature
