      "To create a variable using 'var' in JavaScript, you declare it with the 'var' keyword. 'var' creates variables that are either function-scoped or globally-scoped.",
    steps: [
      "Use the 'var' keyword",
      "Choose a descriptive variable name",
      "Optionally, initialize the variable with a value",
      "Be aware of function or global scope",
    ],
    example: `// Using var (function-scoped or globally-scoped)
var x = 10;
if (true) {
  var x = 20; // This will overwrite the previous x
}
console.log(x); // Outputs 20

// Caution: var can lead to unexpected behavior due to hoisting
console.log(y); // Outputs undefined, not an error
var y = 5;`,
    wrongExample: `// Incorrect usage of var
var 123abc = "invalid name"; // Invalid: starts with a number
var function = "reserved word"; // Invalid: uses a reserved keyword
var globalVar = "avoid globals"; // Caution: creates a global variable`,
    tips: [
      "Avoid using 'var' in modern JavaScript; prefer 'let' or 'const'",

    ],
    scratch: "var [VARIABLE_NAME] = [VALUE];",
    explanation:
      "Variables declared with 'var' are function-scoped or globally-scoped. This means they are accessible throughout the entire function they're declared in, or globally if declared outside any function. 'var' variables are also hoisted, which means their declarations (but not initializations) are moved to the top of their scope.",
    wrongExplanation:
      "In the wrong examples, '123abc' is an invalid variable name as it starts with a number. 'function' is a reserved word in JavaScript and can't be used as a variable name. Creating global variables with 'var' outside of functions (like 'globalVar') is generally discouraged as it can lead to naming conflicts and hard-to-debug code.",

    title: "let (Block Scope)",
    description:
      "To create a variable using 'let' in JavaScript, you declare it with the 'let' keyword. 'let' creates block-scoped variables.",

    example: `// Using let (block-scoped)
let count = 0;
if (true) {
  let count = 1; // This creates a new variable, doesn't affect outer count
  console.log(count); // Outputs 1
}
console.log(count); // Outputs 0

// Proper use: let for variables that will be reassigned
let score = 75;
score = score + 25; // Now score is 100
console.log(score); // Outputs 100`,
    wrongExample: `// Incorrect usage of let
let x = 5;
let x = 10; // Error: can't redeclare block-scoped variable
{
  console.log(y); // Error: can't use before declaration
  let y = 20;
}
console.log(y); // Error: y is not defined in this scope`,
    tips: [
      "Use 'let' for variables that will be reassigned",

      "Don't redeclare variables with 'let' in the same scope",
      "Initialize 'let' variables before using them",
    ],
    scratch: "let [VARIABLE_NAME] = [VALUE];",
    explanation:
      "'let' declares variables that are block-scoped, meaning they are only accessible within the nearest set of curly braces {} where they are declared. This prevents accidental modifications of variables outside the current block. 'let' allows reassignment, making it useful for variables whose values need to change over time.",
    wrongExplanation:
      "In the wrong examples, redeclaring 'x' with 'let' in the same scope causes an error. Trying to use 'y' before its declaration within the same block also causes an error, as 'let' doesn't hoist like 'var'. Attempting to access 'y' outside its block scope results in an error because 'let' variables are not accessible outside their block.",

    title: "const (Block Scope, Immutable)",
    description:
      "To create a constant variable in JavaScript, you declare it with the 'const' keyword. 'const' creates block-scoped variables that cannot be reassigned.",
    steps: [
      "Use the 'const' keyword",
      "Choose a descriptive variable name (often in UPPER_CASE for true constants)",
      "Initialize the variable with a value (required)",
      "Be aware of block scope and immutability",
    ],
    example: `// Using const (block-scoped, cannot be reassigned)
const PI = 3.14159;
// PI = 3.14; // This would cause an error

// Note: const for objects and arrays (their properties can be modified)
const user = { name: 'John', age: 30 };
user.age = 31; // This is allowed
console.log(user);

// user = { name: 'Jane' }; // This would cause an error

// Best practice: Use const for variables that won't be reassigned
const DAYS_IN_WEEK = 7; // Correct usage of const
console.log(DAYS_IN_WEEK);`,
    wrongExample: `// Incorrect usage of const
const X; // Error: missing initializer in const declaration
const Y = 10;
Y = 20; // Error: assignment to a constant variable
{
  console.log(Z); // Error: cannot access 'Z' before initialization
  const Z = 30;
}
console.log(Z); // Error: Z is not defined in this scope`,
    tips: [
      "Use 'const' as your default choice when declaring variables",
      "Always initialize 'const' variables when declaring them",
      "Remember that 'const' prevents reassignment, not modification of object properties",
      "Use 'const' for values that shouldn't change throughout your program",
    ],
    scratch: "const [VARIABLE_NAME] = [VALUE];",
    explanation:
      "'const' declares variables that are block-scoped and cannot be reassigned after initialization. For primitive values, this means the value cannot be changed at all. For objects and arrays, while the reference cannot be changed, the contents can still be modified. This makes 'const' ideal for declaring constants or variables that shouldn't be reassigned.",
    wrongExplanation:
      "In the wrong examples, declaring 'X' without initialization is an error as 'const' requires immediate initialization. Attempting to reassign 'Y' causes an error because 'const' variables cannot be reassigned.

    explanation:
      "Here, we're using console.log() to print out both a string and the value of a variable. This is extremely useful when debugging, as it allows you to see the current state of your variables at different points in your code execution.",
